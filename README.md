CSpace is peer-to-peer communication software of unknown origin, claiming to
offer users an unusually high degree of privacy.


## Background

CSpace was brought to public attention by mention in a document purportedly
leaked by NSA whistleblower [Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) -
[http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35535.pdf](http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35535.pdf),
page 20.  The document suggests use of CSpace, in conjunction with other named
tools, may result in NSA's "near-total loss/lack of insight to target
communications, presence".  

The CSpace source code was downloaded from
[cspace.aabdalla.com](http://cspace.aabdalla.com/releases/cspace-0.1.27.tar.gz)
on 31 December 2014.  Since the code was freely available for public download,
and no copyright or licence statements could be found therein or on the hosting
site, I am making a good faith assumption that it is public domain (or some
similar legal fiction, as appropriate).  


## Disclaimers

I did not write CSpace; do not use it; do not have any insight into its
original authorship or purposes; have not reaviewed the code in any meaninful
way; cannot help you with bugs/support/etc; and do not assert the truth or
falsehood of the CSpace privacy claims.  

I have *no freakin' idea* if this software works at all.  I have uploaded the
source to Github to foster healthy, open civic debate.

There is a decent chance that users of this software will experience
increased surveillance and resultingly *decreased* personal privacy.

**Do not use this software**; or if you must, use it at your own risk.
