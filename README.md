CSpace is peer-to-peer communication software of unknown origin, claiming to
offer users an unusually high degree of privacy.


## Background

CSpace was brought to public attention by mention in a document 
([www.spiegel.de/media/media-35535.pdf](http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35535.pdf),
page 20) purportedly leaked by NSA whistleblower 
[Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden).  The document
suggests use of CSpace, in conjunction with other named tools, may result in
NSA's "near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence".  

The CSpace source code was downloaded from
[cspace.aabdalla.com](http://cspace.aabdalla.com/releases/cspace-0.1.27.tar.gz)
on 31 December 2014.  The code was freely available to the public for download,
and no copyright or license statements could be found therein or on the hosting
site.  I am therefore making a good faith assumption that it is public domain
(or analagous legal construct, as appropriate).   The [draft CSpace Wikipedia 
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:CSpace) lists the license as GPL, but
I can find no other evidence to support that claim.

If you find CSpace interesting, you may wish to clone this repo to your local
computer, in case it gets censored in the future.


## Disclaimers

I did not write CSpace; do not use it; do not have any insight into its
original authorship or purposes; have not reviewed the code in any meaninful
way; cannot help you with bugs/support/etc; and do not assert the truth or
falsehood of the CSpace privacy claims.  

I have *no freakin' idea* if this software works at all.  I have uploaded the
source to Github to foster healthy, open civic debate.

There is a decent chance that users of this software will experience
increased surveillance and resultingly *decreased* personal privacy.

**Do not use this software**; or if you must, use it at your own risk.
